    Unheralded death metal kings Replicant return with an album that will send shock waves through
    the scene. They've honed their brand of technical, dissonant and groovy death metal and forged a
    sound that's nigh unparalleled. They've distilled the best elements of them all into a sonically
    potent, visceral and frankly devastating album that's perfect in nearly all aspects. This is the
    sound of death metal of the times - it's forward-thinking, suitably dissonant, effortlessly
    catchy, semi-technical and simply explosive in its execution. There are various twists and turns
    that keep things interesting and even unpredictable, without derailing its powerful momentum.
    It's rare to come across an album that's so well-rounded, impactful and one that leaves a
    lasting impression. Replicant have not only completely surpassed expectations from people with
    their new one, but have set new standards for contemporary death metal with 'Malignant Reality'.
