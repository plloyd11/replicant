Replicant's debut EP Worthless Desires introduced the world to the band's caustic blend of technical, dissonant death metal rooted in the grit of the New Jersey underground. Four tracks of relentless precision — from the lurching opener "Ripped From Within" to the winding closer "Anti-Instinct: The Withered End" — established a sound that was equal parts cerebral and punishing. Self-produced by Peter Lloyd at One Stone Recording & Mastering, the EP earned early acclaim and signaled the arrival of a band with far more ambition than its brief runtime might suggest.
