reviews:
    - quote: 'Negative Life is a cinematic-level experience that takes me by the hand and guides me through the rough and tumble walk of death metal fervor. Negative Life isn’t just badass, it’s pretty damn clever as well. Put yourself in Roy Batty’s porcelain-alloy kicks and ask yourself, “How would you feel?”'

    - quote: "Nobody out there sounds like Replicant, and Replicant is officially at the top of their game. Infinite Mortality is their best work so far, an enormous destructive machine dripping blood and oil that will crush you between its horrible steel jaws. It's focused, quirky, and hideous as can be, filled with groove that's more infectious than the plague. Get this one in your ears ASAP."
