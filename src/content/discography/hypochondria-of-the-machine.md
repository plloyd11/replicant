Five years ago REPLICANT unleashed two discordant blistering tracks emulsified into a digital release dubbed Hypochondria of the Machine, which gave listeners a bleak glimpse into the band’s foray into a more focused approach as witnessed on their following full length Malignant Reality. Mixed and mastered by Rob Torres (TOMBS, WINDFAERER, TOMBSTONER, ABACINATE) at Frightbox Recording, this also marked the first REPLICANT release that was not self-produced. “Hymns of Distress” and “Limbic Thrust” deliver what REPLICANT are known for—dark technicality that is unabashedly groovy with devastating themes. The initial emission of Hypochondria of the Machine was condemned to exist in a digital state until now! Transcending Obscurity has revived these dark hymns on wax in an exclusive 7-inch.
