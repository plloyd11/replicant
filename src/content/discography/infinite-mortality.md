reviews:
    - quote: "The simple truth is that Replicant have me head over heels for Infinite Mortality. It's brutal, it's smart as hell, and it's a novel entry in the wild world of skronky death. You'd be remiss to let it pass you by."

    - quote: "Nobody out there sounds like Replicant, and Replicant is officially at the top of their game. Infinite Mortality is their best work so far, an enormous destructive machine dripping blood and oil that will crush you between its horrible steel jaws. It's focused, quirky, and hideous as can be, filled with groove that's more infectious than the plague. Get this one in your ears ASAP."

After having smashed prevailing standards for the style with their unique approach on their highly lauded previous release, Replicant take things further still with their third full length, finding ways to make their music <span class="text-replicant-200">even more convoluted and impactful</span> while retaining their trademark dissonant and catchy sound. They've found ways to add new aspects to it without hampering the momentum, constantly changing things up with the listener's body still lashing uncontrollably. The songs veer off in their own unexpected, thrilling directions while upholding the inherent semblance of groove, only to reconnect later with greater force. Things seem to add up and make sense as the album progresses — an ostensibly innocuous mechanical contraption getting constant upgrades to become potentially world-ending. There's fire in the songwriting, the members refusing to succumb to the lull of complacency and working furiously, constantly on the songs to elevate them to a rarefied category.
