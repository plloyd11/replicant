Unheralded death metal kings Replicant return with an album that will send shock waves through the scene. They've honed their brand of technical, dissonant and groovy death metal and forged a sound that's nigh unparalleled. They've distilled the best elements of them all into a sonically potent, visceral and frankly devastating album that's perfect in nearly all aspects. This is the sound of death metal of the times - it's forward-thinking, suitably dissonant, effortlessly catchy, semi-technical and simply explosive in its execution. There are various twists and turns that keep things interesting and even unpredictable, without derailing its powerful momentum. It's rare to come across an album that's so well-rounded, impactful and one that leaves a lasting impression. Replicant have not only completely surpassed expectations from people with their new one, but have set new standards for contemporary death metal with 'Malignant Reality'.
